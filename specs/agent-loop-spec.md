# Spec: `run_agent()`

**File:** `agent.py`
**Status:** Partially pre-filled — complete the two blank fields before implementing

---

## Purpose

Orchestrate a single conversational turn for the Plant Advisor agent. Given a user message and the conversation history, call the LLM with available tools, execute any tool calls the LLM requests, and return the final text response.

This is the core of what makes Plant Advisor an *agent* rather than a simple chatbot: the ability to decide which tools to call, use their results to inform its response, and loop until it has everything it needs.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `user_message` | `str` | The user's current message |
| `history` | `list` | Gradio conversation history — list of `[user_msg, assistant_msg]` pairs |

**Output:** `str`

The agent's final text response for this turn. Should never be empty — if something goes wrong, return a user-readable fallback message.

## Design Decisions

*Read `specs/system-design.md` (especially the "How the Groq Tool Calling API Works" section) before reviewing these. Complete the two blank fields before writing any code.*

---

### Messages list structure

The messages list must start with the system prompt, then replay the conversation
history, then add the new user message. Gradio history is a list of `[user, assistant]`
pairs — convert each pair to two API-format dicts:

```python
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}]

for user_msg, assistant_msg in history:
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_msg})
    if assistant_msg:
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_msg})

messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
```

---

### Initial LLM call

Pass the model, the messages list, the tool definitions, and `tool_choice="auto"`
so the LLM can decide whether to call a tool or respond directly:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    tools=TOOL_DEFINITIONS,
    tool_choice="auto",
)
```

---

### Detecting tool calls in the response

The response object has a `choices` list. Index 0 gives the assistant message.
Check its `tool_calls` attribute — if it's truthy, the LLM wants to call tools:

```python
assistant_message = response.choices[0].message

if not assistant_message.tool_calls:
    # No tool calls — LLM has a final answer
    ...
```

---

### Appending the assistant message

When there are tool calls, append the full assistant message object to `messages`
**before** appending any tool results. The API requires this ordering — a tool
result message must immediately follow the assistant message that requested it:

```python
messages.append(assistant_message)  # must come first
```

---

### Executing and appending tool results

For each tool call, extract the name and arguments, call `dispatch_tool()`, and
append the result as a `"tool"` role message. The `tool_call_id` links this result
back to the specific tool call that requested it:

```python
for tool_call in assistant_message.tool_calls:
    tool_name = tool_call.function.name
    tool_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
    tool_result = dispatch_tool(tool_name, tool_args)

    messages.append({
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
        "content": tool_result,
    })
```

---

### Loop termination conditions

*The loop should stop when: (a) the LLM returns a response with no tool calls, OR (b) the MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS limit is reached. Describe how you will detect each condition and what you will return in each case.*

```
(a) No tool calls — detected inside the loop via:
      if not assistant_message.tool_calls:
          return assistant_message.content or "<fallback>"
    The guard `or "<fallback>"` is required because the API can return
    content=None even on a text-only reply. Without it we'd silently
    return an empty string, violating the "never empty" contract.

(b) MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS reached — the for-loop over range(MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS)
    exits naturally. At that point every round produced tool calls, so
    the last response has tool_calls and content=None. We must have an
    explicit return *after* the loop:
      return "I reached the tool call limit without a final answer. Please try rephrasing your question."
    Returning response.choices[0].message.content here would produce
    None (and therefore an empty string) — the fallback string is safer.
```

---

### Extracting the final text response

*Once the loop exits because there are no more tool calls, how do you extract the text content from the response object? What field holds the string you should return?*

```
response.choices[0].message.content

- response.choices   → list of completion choices; index 0 is the first (and
                       usually only) choice
- .message           → the assistant message object for that choice
- .content           → the text string the model generated

Always guard with `or fallback` because the API can return content=None.
```

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing.*

**Trace of a working agent turn (what tools were called and in what order):**

```
Query: "How should I care for my calathea?"
Round 1 tool call: lookup_plant({'plant_name': 'calathea'})
Round 2 tool call: get_seasonal_conditions({})
Final response: According to the care data for your calathea, you should water it every 1-2 weeks, keeping the soil consistently moist but not soggy. It's also important to use filtered, distilled, or rainwater to prevent brown edges on the leaves. During the summer season, which is the current season, you should increase humidity and water consistently, while keeping the plant out of direct sun. 
```

**What happens when you ask about a plant that isn't in the database?**

```
I am told it is not in the database, but am given some generic knowledge for the plant.
```

**One thing about the tool call API that surprised you:**

```
It first looked for the alias "string of pearls" and when it was not in the dictionary, it looked for what it assumed would be the actual plant, "senecio rowleyanus".
```
